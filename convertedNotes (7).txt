- **Topic:** Structure of a Proof for Optimal Substructure
- **Details of the Process:**
  1. **Assumption Step:** Start by assuming Op is an optimal solution (often considering the last element), creating Op'.
  2. **Redefinition of Problem:** Modify the constraints of the original problem where Op is a solution. This redefined problem might involve removing items, shortening the distance etc., and now, fewer items are available to choose from.
  3. **Optimality Proving Steps:**
      - Prove that Op' is an optimal solution for this redefined problem.
      - Find Op'' by considering alternative solutions to the redefined problem.
      - Add something back to Op' to formulate a new answer to the original question.
      - Compare Op' + extra piece to Op. If Op' + extra is better or more optimal than Op, it leads to a contradiction since Op was assumed optimal. If not, it reinforces the optimality of Op.
  4. **Conclusion:** Such contradiction would imply that Op' must also have been optimal under the redefined problem scope, thereby showing that the problem retains optimal substructure.

- **Key Learning Points:**
  - The proof effectively uses assumption, contradiction, and logical extension steps to establish the validity of optimal substructure in decision-making problems.
  - This approach is fundamental in proving why greedy algorithms and dynamic programming approaches are effective for problems characterized by optimal substructure.

**Continued Application:**

- Anticipate practical application exercises or theoretical questions in upcoming content to consolidate understanding.
