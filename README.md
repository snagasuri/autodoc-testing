# Autodoc- automatically updating documentation that grows with your codebase
Autodoc works by using github actions to detect when a pull request is made, then it reviews the file, and takes the previous docs, and annexes the new information into the docs using llama 3, then pushes it to the readme file to update the github page automatically.

# Documentation Updated for hi_there.txt
A simple yet intriguing file!

**File Name:** hi_there.txt

**README Content:** # Documentation Updated for hi_there.txt

**Analysis:**

The file name "hi_there.txt" suggests a casual, informal tone, which might indicate that the file contains a personal or friendly message. The file extension ".txt" implies that it's a plain text file, which is often used for simple text-based documents.

The README content, "# Documentation Updated for hi_there.txt", seems to be a header or a note that provides context about the file. The fact that it's a documentation update suggests that the file might have undergone changes or revisions.

**Possible Contents:**

Based on the file name and README content, I'm going to take an educated guess that the file contains:

1. A simple text message or greeting, such as a "Hello World" or a friendly message.
2. A note or a letter written in a casual tone, possibly from one person to another.
3. A documentation or a changelog for a project or a software, detailing updates or changes made to the file.
4. A script or a code snippet that uses the "hi_there" phrase as a variable or a placeholder.

Overall, the file name and README content suggest a lightweight, text-based file that might be used for personal or informal purposes.
