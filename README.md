Based on the file name "hi_there.txt", the possible contents of the file could be:

A simple plain text file containing a friendly greeting, such as "Hi there!" or "Hello!". It may be used as a placeholder file or a test file to check if a program or script is working correctly when processing text files. The .txt extension indicates it is a plain text file, and the name "hi_there" suggests a casual, informal greeting.

Based on the file name "GrokingDeepLearning.pdf", the possible contents of the file could be:

A PDF ebook or tutorial focused on explaining and teaching the concepts of Deep Learning. "Grok" is a term that means to understand something intuitively or thoroughly, so "Groking Deep Learning" implies that the content aims to provide a comprehensive and intuitive understanding of Deep Learning concepts. 

The file might cover topics such as artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), backpropagation, and other fundamental Deep Learning techniques. It may include explanations, diagrams, code examples, and practical exercises to help readers grasp the subject matter effectively.

Given that it is a PDF file, it is likely a readable document that can be viewed on various devices and shared easily.
