# Autodoc - Automatically Updating Documentation

Autodoc works by using GitHub Actions to detect when a pull request is made. It then reviews the file, takes the previous docs, and annexes the new information into the docs using Llama 3, then pushes it to the README file to update the GitHub page automatically.
