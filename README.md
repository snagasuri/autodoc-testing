# Autodoc - Automatically Updating Documentation

Autodoc works by using GitHub Actions to detect when a pull request is made. It then reviews the file, takes the previous docs, and annexes the new information into the docs using Llama 3, then pushes it to the README file to update the GitHub page automatically.

## Latest Update: Unknown file

Here is the structured response:

**Brief Description:** The file "hi_there.txt" is a plain text file that appears to contain a simple text message or note written in a casual tone.

**Possible Contents:**

• A simple text message or greeting, such as a "Hello World" or a friendly message.
• A note or a letter written in a casual tone, possibly from one person to another.

**Additional Observations or Insights:** The file name and README content suggest a lightweight, text-based file that might be used for personal or informal purposes. The fact that the README content mentions "Documentation Updated for hi_there.txt" suggests that the file might have undergone changes or revisions, which could be related to a project or a software. However, the file name itself doesn't necessarily imply a technical or formal context, making a simple text message or note a more likely possibility.
